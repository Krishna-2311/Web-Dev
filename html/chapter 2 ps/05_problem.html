        media as "Khiladi Kumar",[3][4] through his career spanning over 30 years, Kumar has appeared in over 150 films
        and has won several awards, including two <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Awards">National Film Awards</a> and two Filmfare Awards. He received the Padma
        Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian honour, from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India ">Government of India</a> in 2009. Kumar is one of the most
        prolific actors in Indian cinema.[5][6] Forbes included Kumar in their lists of both highest-paid celebrities
        and highest-paid actors in the world from 2015 to 2020.[7][8] Between 2019 and 2020, he was the only Indian on

        Kumar began his career in 1991 with Saugandh and had his first commercial success a year later with the action
        thriller Khiladi. The film established him as an action star in the 1990s and led to several films in the
        Khiladi film series, in addition to other action films such as Mohra (1994) and Jaanwar (1999). Although his
        early tryst with romance in Yeh Dillagi (1994) was positively received, it was in the next decade that Kumar
        expanded his range of roles. He gained recognition for the romantic films Dhadkan (2000), Andaaz (2003),
        Namastey London (2007), and for his slapstick comic performances in several films including Hera Pheri (2000),
        Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), Phir Hera Pheri (2006), Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007), and Singh Is Kinng (2008). Kumar
        won Filmfare Awards for his negative role in Ajnabee (2001) and his comic performance in Garam Masala (2005).
